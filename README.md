# Facebook Pixel Events for Thrive Quiz

Plugin for Thrive Quiz Builder to Send Facebook Pixel Events for each Page


* First, ensure that you have your Facebook Pixel installed on the site

* Install the plugin
* Determine the Events that are sent

Facebook doesnâ€™t give great insights on the events sent - so you need to know what they are to create custom audiences.

The plugin sends a ViewContent event for each page shown, with the content_category being the id of the quiz and the page being the page shown, or if a question, the question id.

##Example of ViewContent events sent:
In this example, we have  a 2 question quiz with an optin and results page.

### Every Question:
content_category: quiz_12

### Optin:
content_name: optin
content_category: quiz_12

### Results:
content_name: results
content_category: quiz_12

## Helper 
You can use the Facebook Pixel Helper for Chrome to see the exact events sent.
